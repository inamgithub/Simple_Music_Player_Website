# Spotify Clone Project

This project is a simple Spotify clone that aims to replicate some of the basic features of the popular music streaming platform. It includes a user interface designed using HTML and CSS, as well as functionality implemented with JavaScript. The project allows users to play and control songs, displays song information, and features a responsive design.

## Features

- **Navigation Bar**: The navigation bar at the top includes the Spotify logo, along with links to the Home and About sections. It is designed with a sleek black background and white text for easy visibility.

- **Song List**: The main content area displays a list of songs under the title "Best of NCS - No Copyrights". Each song is presented with its cover image, song name, and a play button with a timestamp. The play button allows users to start and pause the song.

- **Song Banner**: A banner section at the bottom of the page features playback controls. Users can control the playback progress using a slider, and there are icons for previous, play/pause, and next actions. An animated GIF image is displayed when a song is playing.

## Design and Styling

The project's design features a dark theme with a green background color for the body. The navigation bar and song list have a consistent color scheme with black backgrounds and white text. The song list items are designed with rounded corners and display song cover images, enhancing the visual appeal of the interface. The playback controls in the banner section are centered and offer a clean and straightforward look.

## JavaScript Functionality

The JavaScript code included in the project adds interactive functionality to the interface. It enables users to play and pause songs, control the playback progress using the progress bar, and displays an animated GIF when a song is playing. The song data is stored in an array, and the script allows for dynamic switching between songs.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Interact with the interface by clicking on the play buttons, controlling the playback progress, and using the playback control icons.

Please note that this project is a basic representation of Spotify's functionality and is for educational purposes. It showcases how to build a simple music player using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
